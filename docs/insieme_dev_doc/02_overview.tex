\begin{itemize}
  \item Insieme Compiler vs. Insieme Runtime
  \item Compiler - tool kit to build compiler related utilities,
  transformations, analysis, \ldots
  \item Runtime - framework controlling the execution of an application;
  extended by providing alternative implementations of given functionality; flow
  of control is dictated by the runtime
  \item Point out difference: Compiler = Library = Toolkit, Runtime = Framework
\end{itemize}


State that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Each ``component'' should represent a closed entity - usable via a simple
  user friendly interface without the requirement of modifying internal code
  \item Each component has to declare itself as a ``framework'' or ``library'' -
  define those two terms!
  \item Extendable by design - not re-design
  \item Coding standards
\end{itemize}
