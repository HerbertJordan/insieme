\section{The Machine Learning Module}

The machine learning part of insieme is mainly designed to pick the best configuration out of several ones. For example it is used to predict the correct splitting of an OpenCL kenerl over all available devices. It is implemented based on the Shark library~\cite{shark}, providing an interface for Artificial Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNets) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). \\

During training as well as the classification is based, the features are read/written form/to a database with a certain layout, described in section~\ref{sec:Compiler.Frontend.ml.databaseLayout}. The current implementation uses the Kompex library~\cite{kompex} to access SQLite databases~\cite{sqlite}. \\

The machine learning can either be used by including the corresponding headers in a C++ program or by just using the provided executables. The following code shows an example how to use machine learning in a simple program. \\

\begin{insCode}
#include "ReClaM/Svm.h"
#include "ReClaM/MeanSquaredError.h"
#include "insieme/machine_learning/myModel.h"
#include "insieme/machine_learning/trainer.h"


int main() {
	// set up some parameters
	std::string dbPath = /*path to database file*/;
	size_t nClasses = /*number of classes for the current problem*/;
	
	// construct a SVM
	RBFKernel kernel;
	insieme::ml::MyMultiClassSVM svm(kernel, nClasses); 
	SVM_Optimizer optimizer;
	MeanSquaredError err;
	insieme::ml::Trainer trainer(dbPath, svm, GenNNoutput::ML_KEEP_INT);
	
	// set static/dynamic features to train 
	trainer.setStaticFeaturesByName(/*std::vector containing the names of the desired static features*/);
	trainer.setDynamicFeaturesByName(/*std::vector containing the names of the desired dynamic features*/);
	// set the name of target to train for
	trainer->setTargetByName(/*string with the name of the target*/);
	
	// do the training
	double error = trainer->train(optimizer, err, 0);
	
	// evaluate the trained model using some certain pattern
	Array<double> testPattern;
	/* fill pattern with values to test */
	size_t predictedClass = trainer.evaluate(testPattern);
}
\end{insCode}

This code snipped trains a SVM, for FFNets it work similar, just the shape of the network has to be set up passing a connection matrix of type \type{Array<int>} created with the Shark-provided function \decl{createConnectionMatrix} to the FFnet's constructor. The difference between static and dynamic features is described in Section~\ref{sec:Compiler.Frontend.ml.databaseLayout}. The third argument of \decl{insieme::ml::Trainer(const std::string\& myDbPath, MyModel\& myModel, enum GenNNoutput genOutput = ML\_MAP\_TO\_N\_CLASSES, std::ostream\& outstream = std::cout)} describes how the values of the target in the database are mapped to the different classes. Table~\ref{tab:Compiler.Frontend.ml.GenNNoutput} shows the awailable options. The provided executables listed in Talble~\ref{tab:Compiler.Frontend.ml.execs} always use the option \insCodeInl{ML\_KEEP\_INT} since this is the only option currently in use;
