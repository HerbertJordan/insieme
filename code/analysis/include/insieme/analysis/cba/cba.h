	 * The main facade function for utilizing the constraint-based analysis framework (CBA).

	 * Analysis are capable of deducing values of expressions within a given code fragment. The fragment
	 * is determined by the root node of the given expr-address, while the expression itself is addressing
	 * the targeted expression. The kind of information to be obtained can be determined by the type
	 * parameter and potential parameters is determined by the type parameter. A catalog of those is
	 * provided by the header files located within the cba/analysis directory. Additional analysis
	 * may be defined for specific tasks.

	 * For Example usages see the
