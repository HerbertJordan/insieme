# Insieme: Compiler and Runtime Infrastructure
The Insieme compiler is a source-to-source compiler for C/C++ that supports portable parallel abstractions (OpenMP, MPI and OpenCL) for heterogeneous multi-core architectures. More deatails are available [here](http://insieme-compiler.org/mission.html).

## Directory Structure
Insieme contains 4 main sub-directories:

* insieme
  * /code -- Insieme compiler implementation
  * /docs -- Insieme developer documentation
  * /scripts -- Insieme environment installation scripts
  * /test -- Insieme integration tests

## Installation 
Insieme is written in C++11 and relies on several third-party libraries, an updated list is available [here](http://insieme-compiler.org/license.html).

### Preparing the Environment
You can either install those packages manually (or via a package manager) or use the provided utility which takes care of building all dependencies from scratch and apply patches. 
```
cd scripts
make PREFIX=/where/to/install 
```
All libraries will be installed in ``$PREFIX`` and a symbolic link is created with postfix '-latest' pointing to the newest installed version of a library (which simplifies the following cmake configuration steps). By default ``PREFIX=~/lib``; additionally the script performs a parallel build (``make -j$SLOTS``) using all availabe cores in the host architecture. You can change this behaviour by passing to the make a different value for ``SLOTS``.

### Building Insieme
Insieme's build system is based on CMake. We suppose to have the all dependencies installed in the same directory: ``$HOME/libs``

```
mkdir build
cd build

# SET ENVIRONMENT 
export PREFIX=$HOME/libs
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PREFIX/gcc-latest/lib64:$PREFIX/mpfr-latest/lib:$PREFIX/mpc-latest/lib:\\
  $PREFIX/gmp-latest/lib:$PREFIX/cloog-gcc-latest/lib:$PREFIX/ppl-latest/lib:$PREFIX/papi-latest/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=$PREFIX/ruby-latest/bin/:$PREFIX/cmake-latest/bin:$PATH

# CREATE PROJECT MAKEFILE
CXX=$PREFIX/gcc-latest/bin/g++ INSIEME_LIBS_HOME=$PREFIX $PREFIX/cmake-latest/bin/cmake ..
```

Several other options can be provided to enable/disable some of the compiler features:
- ``-DDOC=ON|OFF`` -- Enable/disable generation of documentation 
- ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug|Release`` -- Set the build to be in Debug or Release mode 
- ``-DUSE_OPENCL=ON|OFF`` -- Enabe/disable OpenCL support (in both frontend/backend/runtime)
(note: this variables must be passed as parameters of the cmake command, not set as environment variables)

If successful, CMake produces the set of Makefiles to build the Insieme project. 

```
make -j2 # Builds using two threads
```

Or you can alternatively mode into a subfolder and only buld that particular module of the compiler
```
cd core
make
```

Unit tests can be executed with:
```
make test
```

Integration tests can be executed using the custom script generated in the build directory:
```
./integration_test.py 
```
Note: The integration test script requires Python 3.x, if your system uses an older version, the installation script installs a recent version in the ``$PREFIX`` folder. In such case you can run integration tests using the following line:
```
$PREFIX/python-latest/bin/python ./integration_test.py
```
Integration tests can be executed in parallel (``-w SLOTS``), and multiple times (``-r N``). For a full list of options use the ``-h`` argument or refer to the insieme developer documentation.
